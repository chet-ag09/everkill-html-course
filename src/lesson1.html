  <h2 class="h2-course">Welcome to the Wonderful World of HTML!</h2>
  <p class="p-course">In this first lesson, we'll embark on a journey to understand the fundamental building block of the web: HTML.  HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language.  Don't worry about memorizing that long name for now – we'll break it down piece by piece.</p>
  
  <h2 class="h2-course"> What is HTML?</h2>
  <p class="p-course">Imagine a web page as a house.  The bricks and mortar are the content we see – text, images, videos.  But every house needs a blueprint to tell the builders where to put those things.  HTML acts as that blueprint for web pages.  It tells web browsers how to structure and display the content we create.</p>  
  
  <h2 class="h2-course">Tags in html</h2>
  <p class="p-course">Tags: These are special keywords wrapped in angle brackets (< and >) that define different parts of a web page. Imagine them as labels on a blueprint. For example, the < h1 > tag defines a heading, and the < p > tag defines a paragraph.</p>

  <h4 class="h4-course">Next Steps</h4>
  <p class="p-course">In the next lesson, we'll create our first simple HTML document and see how it translates into a web page.  We'll learn how to use tags to structure our content and bring our web page to life!</p>
